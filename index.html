            <h1>Why the Apple Podcast App Sucks</h1>
            
            <p>By: Madeline Howard</p>
             
            <br>

            <p>I am a nerd who loves podcasts. I listen to them while working, eating, getting ready, and driving. So over my many years of listening to podcasts I have experience with multiple podcast sharing apps.</p>

            <p>And no app is worse than the Apple Podcast App.</p>

            <p>I actually completely gave up on the app completely because it goes against every common sense way of accessing any podcast. But my main design focus and question that led me down the path for this project was:</p>
            <br>
            <p><em>“Why doesn’t the home page show me recently listened to podcasts first?”</em></p>
            <br>

            <h2>Complain, Empathize, and Discover</h2>
            <br>

            <p>During the process of evaluating the home interface of the app I noticed some pretty glaring issues. The home screen isn’t streamlined for convenience and has a lot of unnecessary recommended content. Furthermore, the podcasts we see on the top of the app aren’t the most recently listened to, instead they are the most recent podcasts from each author. It isn’t until we scroll past all of the unnecessary fluff that we get to the podcast the user was currently listening to. </p>

            <p>In discussing these pain points, we make our way to the main design question of this project:</p>

            <p><em>“How can the homepage be optimized for users using the Podcast App?”</em></p>
            <br>

            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <br>

            <p>Through the user research process I wanted to find out what a typical user usually does as soon as they open their podcast app. So I asked some very basic questions:</p>
            <br>

            <ol>Where are you when you're listening to podcasts?</ol>
            <ol>When opening the podcast app what are you trying to do first? </ol>
            <ol>What features of the Podcast App do you use the most?</ol> 
            <br>

            <p>With the first question I found that most of my users were very mobile with where they listened to podcasts. Most listened while they were on the move or when they were behind the wheel. This is important as the current layout of the app isn’t streamlined for users whose hands aren’t free. </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <img src="Images/QuestionOne.jpg">
            <br>
            <br>

            <p>The second question helps to determine what feature should be most prominent when opening the app. Through this we can see over half of the users polled are trying to continue a podcast they were previously listening to. So that feature should be the most prominent in the hierarchy. </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>

            <p>The last question was mostly just to gauge what features on the homepage that were being utilized. Only one user said that they used the recommended section of the homepage which currently takes up most of the app's real estate. </p>
            <br>
            <br>

            <br>

            <p>In response to all of this research, the best course of action seems to be to redesign the home screen of the app to better reflect the needs of our respondents. </p>
            <br>
            
            <h2>The Fresh New Look</h2>

            <p>Based on my user research I redesigned the homepage to reflect where the users go first most often. Instead of having the most recent episodes at the top, I’ve moved “Recently Listening To” to the very top and made it large and in charge. That way it's easily accessible at all times. Then the “Downloads” section was moved along with the users library, so that they are always front and center. To make sure there still is a “Recommended” section I moved it to the very bottom of the page to ensure it doesn’t encroach on the space of more important items.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for coming with me through this project! I made this for my SMAD 308 class at James Madison University. </p>
